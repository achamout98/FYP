  This week I sat down with my group members and worked on refining the concept and scope of our rock climbing game. 
  We defined the basic gameplay mechanics that should be applicable whether or not we are working with VR (will be described
  in a separate document). I found a very useful tutorial about implementing rock climbing mechanics for VR in Unity, and will 
  attach the link below. I also downloaded Unity and I am ready to start learning how to code in it once we know what hardware we have
  available at our disposal.
